**Traffic Car Game - Read Me**

Welcome to the Traffic Car Game! Your mission is to skillfully navigate the highway, avoiding collisions with enemy cars while trying to achieve the highest score possible. Below is a detailed guide on how the game works:

### Gameplay Overview
- Objective: Steer your car (yellow) through traffic, avoiding enemy cars (green) while trying to pass as many as possible to increase your score.
- Controls: 
  - Use the arrow keys (or specific keys, depending on your setup) to control your car’s movement.
  - Navigate left, right, or accelerate to dodge oncoming cars and maintain your speed.

### Scoring System
- Your score is determined by how many enemy cars you successfully pass.
- Score Increment: The score increases by 10 points every time the rear end of your car (yellow) passes the rear end of an enemy car (green). Precision driving is key to maximizing your score.

### Speed Mechanics
- Starting Speed: The game begins with your car traveling at a speed of 5 units.
- Speed Increase: Every 5 seconds, your car’s speed automatically increases by 1 unit. This gradual increase in speed adds to the challenge, requiring quicker reflexes and more strategic maneuvers as the game progresses.
  
### Game Difficulty
- As the speed of your car increases, the game becomes more challenging, requiring sharper reactions and better timing to avoid collisions and continue passing enemy cars.

### Tips for Success
- Stay focused: As your speed increases, the window for avoiding enemy cars narrows.
- Plan your moves: Anticipate the positions of enemy cars to time your passes perfectly.
- Keep calm: The game will get faster, but steady and precise driving will help you achieve a higher score.

### End of Game
- The game ends when your car collides with an enemy car or when you decide to exit. Your final score will be displayed, reflecting how many cars you successfully passed.

Good luck on the road, and see how high you can score!
